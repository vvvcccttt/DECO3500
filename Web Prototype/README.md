The "3500 - mobile" folder contains the team's web prototype content. The "image" folder within "3500 - mobile" contains the images and icons used for the prototype design. The "map" folder within "3500 - mobile" contains the functional code and some images needed for Part D of the prototype (including the "Road" Interface, "Recommend" Interface, and "Place Recommend" Interface). To use the team's web prototype, you need to click on the "index.html" file within the "3500 - mobile" folder, which serves as the initial interface of the prototype. Clicking the question mark in the top right corner of the initial interface will trigger the privacy policy, and the user must agree to the privacy policy before continuing to use the prototype.

Afterward, users can follow the instructions provided in the [Introduction to How the Prototype is Used](https://github.com/vvvcccttt/DECO3500/wiki/%22FamTrip%22-Design-Process#high-fidelity-prototypes) to interact with the pages and fully experience all the features of the four parts of the web prototype.

The **Interaction and Technical Details 1.md** document primarily focuses on the interaction and technical details for **Prototype Part A**, **Part B**, and **Part D** (excluding the navigation and route planning features). It details how these sections of the prototype operate, covering their user interactions and the technical implementations behind those functionalities.

The **Interaction and Technical Details 2.md** document is dedicated to explaining the interaction and technical details of **Prototype Part C**. 

The **Interaction and Technical Details 3.md** document focuses on **Prototype Part D**, specifically covering the **navigation and route planning features**. It provides details on how these features are implemented and how users interact with them, highlighting the technical aspects of route planning, navigation assistance, and related user interfaces.

The prototype's deployment environment is a static hosting service (GitHub Pages). After downloading the files, users can also run it locally on their computers.
