## The Repository 
The repository contains folders such as **"Persona,"** **"Team_Charter,"** **"Team_Presentation_1_PowerPoint,"** and **"Prototype."** 

The **"Persona"** folder includes the "user personas" we created for the users. 

The **"Team_Charter"** folder contains the team's charter, including the team overview, the decision-making process, and their signatures, among other things. 

The **"Team_Presentation_1_PowerPoint"** folder showcases the proposal slides, which are the outcome of the teamâ€™s design proposal assignment. 

The **"Prototype"** folder displays images of sketches, low-fidelity prototypes, medium-fidelity prototypes, and high-fidelity prototypes (Picture1, Picture2, Picture3, Picture4).
