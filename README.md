# DECO3500
## The Repository 
The repository contains folders such as **"Persona,"** **"Team_Charter,"** **"Exhibition Materials,"**  **"Team_Presentation_1_PowerPoint,"** **"Web Prototype"**  and **"Prototype."** 

The **"Persona"** folder includes the "user personas" we created for the users. 

The **"Team_Charter"** folder contains the team's charter, including the team overview, the decision-making process, and their signatures, among other things. 

The **"Team_Presentation_1_PowerPoint"** folder showcases the proposal slides, which are the outcome of the teamâ€™s design proposal assignment. 

The **"Prototype"** folder displays images of sketches, low-fidelity prototypes, medium-fidelity prototypes, and high-fidelity prototypes (Picture1, Picture2, Picture3, Picture4).

The **"Exhibition Materials"** folder includes a poster.

The **"Web Prototype"** folder contains the team's web prototype and related design materials.

## Deployment and Usage of the Prototype

The prototype is divided into four parts:

Part A consists of the "Login (Welcome)" interface, "Login" interface, "Join" interface, "Sign up" interface, and "Slogan" interface. This section primarily focuses on login methods, registration information, or joining an existing travel plan.

Part B includes the "Input1" interface, "Input2" interface, "Input Room/Food/Place" interface, "Input example" interface, "Outline" interface, and "Plan Home" interface. Part B mainly covers the itinerary setup process for users. Based on the inputted destination and travel preferences (such as budget and accommodation style), the system creates a personalized travel plan for the user.

Part C contains the "Chat Manage" interface, "Family Chat 1" interface, "Family Chat 2" interface, "Vote" interface, "Family Chat 3" interface, "Family Chat 4" interface, and "Position" interface. Family members can collaborate on or adjust the travel plan through chatting, and voting, and can communicate or check each other's location at any time.

Part D is made up of the "Road" interface, "Recommend" interface, and "Place Recommend" interface. This section allows users to navigate to attractions and get recommendations for nearby restaurants and attractions based on their location and navigation information. If time permits, users can visit additional attractions suggested by the system.

(In the "Web Prototype" folder)The "3500 - mobile" folder contains the team's web prototype content. The "image" folder within "3500 - mobile" contains the images and icons used for the prototype design. The "map" folder within "3500 - mobile" contains the functional code and some images needed for Part D of the prototype (including the "Road" Interface, "Recommend" Interface, and "Place Recommend" Interface). To use the team's web prototype, you need to click on the "index.html" file within the "3500 - mobile" folder, which serves as the initial interface of the prototype. Clicking the question mark in the top right corner of the initial interface will trigger the privacy policy, and the user must agree to the privacy policy before continuing to use the prototype.

Afterward, users can follow the instructions provided in the [Introduction to How the Prototype is Used](https://github.com/vvvcccttt/DECO3500/wiki/%22FamTrip%22-Design-Process#high-fidelity-prototypes) to interact with the pages and fully experience all the features of the four parts of the web prototype.

From the perspective of prototype deployment, the system uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create frontend interactions and dynamic content display, offering various interactions through features such as maps and voting. HTML is responsible for creating the structure of the web pages, while CSS is used for styling the pages and implementing responsive layouts. JavaScript mainly handles the interactive logic. On the other hand, the deployment environment is a static hosting service (GitHub), and users can also run the files locally on their own computers after downloading them.
